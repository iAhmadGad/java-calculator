A Calculator written in Java.

It solves maths operations & trigonometric functions in problems of -only- 2 numbers.

Still trying to figure out an algorithm that could solve problems of more than 2 numbers, considering the operator precedence.

## üí° Functions
- Addition, subtraction, multiplacation & division

The calculator can solve the basic maths operations.
- Power, square root & cube root

The calculator can get the number to the power of any number with power operator `^`, it can get the square or cube root of any number as well.
- Trigonometric functions

The calculator provides 3 trigonometric functions ($sin$, $cos$, $tan$), more functions will be added in the future -In shaa Allah-.
- Random number Genarator `rn`

The calculator can generate a random float number (number with decimals), by writing `rn`, & to generate a random number between 2 specific values, write 2 numbers and a comma between them as: `rn5,10`.
